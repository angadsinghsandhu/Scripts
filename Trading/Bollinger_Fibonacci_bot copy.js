//This strategy uses Bollinger bands and Fibonacci retracements to enter and exit trades

/*
This code uses Bollinger bands to enter trades and Fibonacci retracements to set the stop loss 
and take profit levels. It also has logic to exit trades based on the Fibonacci retracement levels.

The strategy first sets the parameters for the Bollinger bands: the length of the moving average (length) 
and the number of standard deviations to use as the band width (multiplier). It then calculates the upper 
and lower Bollinger bands using these parameters.

Next, the strategy sets the Fibonacci retracement levels (level1, level2, level3) that it will use to set 
the stop loss and take profit levels for trades.

The strategy then defines the entry rules for long and short positions. It enters a long position when the 
close price is above the upper Bollinger band, and it enters a short position when the close price is below 
the lower Bollinger band.

The strategy also defines the exit rules for long and short positions using the Fibonacci retracement levels. 
It exits a long position when the close price falls below the entry price multiplied by 
(1 - level1 * stopLoss). It exits a short position when the close price rises above the entry price 
multiplied by (1 + level1 * stopLoss).

Finally, the strategy sets the stop loss and take profit levels (stopLoss and takeProfit) and the number 
of shares to trade (shares). It then enters and exits trades based on the entry and exit rules defined 
earlier.
